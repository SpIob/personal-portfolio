            <h2>Become a Successful YouTuber</h2>
            <p>I wanted to make a successful YouTube channel ever since I was really young. I don't expect to hit big like PewDiePie but I am aiming for at least 100K subscribers.</p>

            <h2>Develop a Full Game</h2>
            <p>It's always been my dream to make my own video game. I've been playing games for a long time so to make one of my own would be something that will make me live happily.</p>

            <h2>Innovate the Computer World</h2>
            <p>It may sound impossible, especially for a guy who spent most of his childhood watching and playing video games all day instead of doing something productive, but I've always wanted to build something that can help change the world.</p>

            <h2>Write My Own Book</h2>
            <p>Making my own fantasy world was something that I've been passively doing as a kid. I played with my action figures and make stories as I go, but I never actually put in real effort into making my own stories. So, I've wanted to create something that's at least as wonderful as Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones.</p>
